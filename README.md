#BlocJams

## About

BlocJams is the first project in the Bloc web developer curriculum. I built this app using HTML and Vanilla JS. This was then refactored in using jQuery.

## Functionality

The app is just a proof of concept really. It contains a landing page, an album page that lists albums, and a song list with a few songs. The album page consists of 1-2 albums that are listed out multiple times in tiles to demonstrate the look of what the final project could/would look like. The songs are just place holders to use for testing. The app includes a player function that allows songs to be played, paused, skip, previous, volume mute, volume slider, and time slider. This is again just to demonstrate how to use these functions in the app as well as demonstrate the interaction between parts of JS to update the view as well as allow interaction from the user.

## Development

The development of this app was a process of guided progress along with assignments to me, the student. The assignments were often based on making changes similar to what was covered in that lesson, but with twists and little to no help.

This was the my first introduction into the building of an app using skills learned from the introduction to HTML, CSS, and JS.

##  Maintenance

This app is not maintained, and is considered completed for the purposes of education. There are many knows issues but they are not going to be addressed.
